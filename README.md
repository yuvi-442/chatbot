                                                 Revolutionizing customer support with an intelligent chatbot for automated assistance .

1.Problem Statement:         
                        Many businesses struggle to handle customer queries 24/7. Long wait times and inconsistent support affect customer satisfaction. We aim to solve this by creating a smart chatbot that provides instant and accurate help.          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2. Objectives of the Project:
                         Our goal is to build a chatbot that can answer common customer questions automatically, reduce wait times, and improve overall support quality.

3. Scope of the Project:
                           We will develop a chatbot with basic Q&A features, use natural language understanding, and test it in a limited environment. Full deployment and multilingual support are beyond our current scope.

4. Data Sources:
                           We’ll use public chatbot training datasets from sources like Kaggle and may create some sample conversations ourselves. The data will be static and pre-downloaded.




5. High-Level Methodology
●	Data Collection: Download data from online sources or create it manually.
●	Data Cleaning: Fix issues like missing or repeated responses.
●	EDA: Use graphs to understand conversation patterns.
●	Feature Engineering: Create tags and intents for better training.
●	Model Building: Use machine learning models like Decision Trees or NLP models like BERT.
●	Model Evaluation: Use accuracy and confusion matrix to check performance.
●	Visualization: Show insights using simple charts.
●	Deployment: If possible, launch a basic chatbot on a web page using Streamlit or Flask.
